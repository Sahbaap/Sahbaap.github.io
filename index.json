The complex dynamics of soft tissue as an unstructured environment is one of the main challenges in any attempt to automate the manipulation of it via a surgical robotic system. Two AI learning based model predictive control algorithms using vision strategies are proposed and studied: (1) reinforcement learning and (2) learning from demonstration. Comparison of the performance of these AI algorithms in a simulation setting indicated that the learning from demonstration algorithm can boost the learning policy by initializing the predicted dynamics with given demonstrations. Furthermore, the learning from demonstration algorithm is implemented on a Raven IV surgical robotic system and successfully demonstrated feasibility of the proposed algorithm using an experimental approach. This study is part of a profound vision in which the role of a surgeon will be redefined as a pure decision maker whereas the vast majority of the manipulation will be conducted autonomously by a surgical robotic system.

To extend previous algorithms as well as to investigate the effects of torque feedback on human roughness perception, we deployed a novel haptic platform with two probes, fingertip and penhandle. Three torque conditions were examined: 1) Slope Torque, which orients the probe perpendicular to the surface, 2) No Torque, where no active torque is provided by the device, and 3) Stiff Torque, where torque feedback is provided to keep the probe upright. A conventional magnitude estimation experiment was performed. The results indicated that both the torque signals and grasp type mediate human perception of virtual textures. Slope Torque led to greater perceived roughness when the fingertip was used, and the fingertip led to higher roughness ratings than the penhandle with the Slope Torque condition. The Slope Torque algorithm appears to be advantageous for generating rougher surfaces compared to the force-based algorithms which are typically limited by the system stability and actuator saturation.","tags":null,"title":"Torque Contribution to Haptic Rendering of Virtual Textures","type":"publication"}]
