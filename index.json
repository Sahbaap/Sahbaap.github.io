The complex dynamics of soft tissue as an unstructured environment is one of the main challenges in any attempt to automate the manipulation of it via a surgical robotic system. Two AI learning based model predictive control algorithms using vision strategies are proposed and studied: (1) reinforcement learning and (2) learning from demonstration. Comparison of the performance of these AI algorithms in a simulation setting indicated that the learning from demonstration algorithm can boost the learning policy by initializing the predicted dynamics with given demonstrations. Furthermore, the learning from demonstration algorithm is implemented on a Raven IV surgical robotic system and successfully demonstrated feasibility of the proposed algorithm using an experimental approach. This study is part of a profound vision in which the role of a surgeon will be redefined as a pure decision maker whereas the vast majority of the manipulation will be conducted autonomously by a surgical robotic system.

However typical large systems are bulky, expensive, and afford limited angular motion, while smaller designs suffer complications arising from limited motion range, speed, and force generation. This work was to develop and validate a simple, compact, low cost single site teleoperated laparoendoscopic surgical robotic system, with demonstrated capability to carry out basic surgical procedures. This system builds upon previous work done at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and includes instrument and endoscope manipulators as well as compact articulated instruments designed to overcome single incision geometry complications. A robotic endoscope holder was used for the base, with an added support frame for teleoperated manipulators and instruments fabricated mostly from 3D printed parts. Kinematics and control methods were formulated for the novel manipulator configuration. Trajectory following results from an optical motion tracker and sample task performance results are presented. Results indicate that the system has successfully met the goal of basic surgical functionality while minimizing physical size, complexity, and cost.","tags":null,"title":"Compact teleoperated laparoendoscopic single‐site robotic surgical system: Kinematics, control, and operation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Sahba Aghajani Pedram**","Roberta Klatzky","Peter Berkelman"],"categories":null,"content":"Short Summary: Novel 6D haptic feedback (both force and torque) strageties were developed to render virtual textures with high fidelity and human perception of such textures was analyzed.\n","date":1483401600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483401600,"objectID":"ae5dbdda8901fd5c60a89edb5818ad4a","permalink":"https://Sahbaap.github.io/publication/textureperception_toh17/","publishdate":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/textureperception_toh17/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the fact that conventional haptic interfaces and rendering algorithms commonly approximate interactions with force only, the dynamic effects of even simple tasks, e.g., writing on a paper, involve both forces and torques. To extend previous algorithms as well as to investigate the effects of torque feedback on human roughness perception, we deployed a novel haptic platform with two probes, fingertip and penhandle. Three torque conditions were examined: 1) Slope Torque, which orients the probe perpendicular to the surface, 2) No Torque, where no active torque is provided by the device, and 3) Stiff Torque, where torque feedback is provided to keep the probe upright. A conventional magnitude estimation experiment was performed. The results indicated that both the torque signals and grasp type mediate human perception of virtual textures. Slope Torque led to greater perceived roughness when the fingertip was used, and the fingertip led to higher roughness ratings than the penhandle with the Slope Torque condition. The Slope Torque algorithm appears to be advantageous for generating rougher surfaces compared to the force-based algorithms which are typically limited by the system stability and actuator saturation.","tags":null,"title":"Torque Contribution to Haptic Rendering of Virtual Textures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Liu","Amirhossein Farvardin","**Sahba Aghajani Pedram**","Iulian Iordachita","Russell H Taylor","Mehran Armand"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1433289600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433289600,"objectID":"85f52dfb19dea701b7013701a12875df","permalink":"https://Sahbaap.github.io/publication/fbgshapesensing_icra15/","publishdate":"2015-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fbgshapesensing_icra15/","section":"publication","summary":"Shape sensing techniques utilizing Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) arrays can enable real-time tracking and control of dexterous continuum manipulators (DCM) used in minimally invasive surgeries. For many surgical applications, the DCM may need to operate with much larger curvatures than what current shape sensing methods can detect. This paper proposes a novel shape sensor, which can detect a radius of curvature of 15 mm for a 35 mm long DCM. For this purpose, we used FBG sensors along with nitinol wires as the supporting substrates to form a triangular cross section. For verification, we assembled the sensor inside the wall of the DCM. Experimental results indicate that the proposed sensor can detect the DCM�s curvature with an average error of 3.14%.","tags":null,"title":"Large Deflection Shape Sensing of a Continuum Manipulator for MinimallyInvasive Surgery","type":"publication"}]
